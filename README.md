# IAmPy

IAmPy is a fork of frappejs (https://github.com/frappe/frappejs), reimplemented in Python.


The objective of IAmPy is be a clean, opinated micro-framework to develop small-business applications.


Frapp√©.io is a nice framework for the development of large business apps, but, it requires the management of many things around like (MariaDb, Redis, Nodejs).


So, I love the simplicity of frappejs, and the Schema define in the framework to act as a Document Oriented framework, what simplify and boost the level of coesion in the system.
