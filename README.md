# IAmPy

IAmPy is a fork of [frappejs](https://github.com/frappe/frappejs), re-implemented in Python.


The objective of IAmPy is be a clean and opinionated micro-framework to develop small-business applications.


[Frappé](https://frappeframework.com) is a nice framework for the development of large business apps, but, it requires the management of many things, like (MariaDb, Redis, Nodejs), that turn hard start small business apps.


So, I love the simplicity of frappejs, and the Schema defined in the frappé framework to act as a Document Oriented framework, but using the power of a Relational Database Engine, what simplify and boost the level of coherence in the system.
